Survoyeur
=========

This will eventually be a Meteor project for answering survey questions. It sort of does that now, but in an incredibly
crude and alpha way.

Instructions
------------

1. Install Meteor, Meteorite &c. in the usual way, and run this application.
2. Go to the root path to answer questions.
3. Go to /questions/summary to see the current vote.
